# The conversion of time series of acceleration, velocity, and displacement
The objective of this code is to develop a converter that enables the conversion of time series of acceleration, velocity, and displacement. Additionally, you will come across an example file named "example.xlsx" which includes instances of acceleration, velocity, and displacement time series. Don't hesitate to adjust the values within the file to conduct various conversion experiments.
